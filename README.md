# StockIntake
A console app that analyzes stocks from a live API and keeps track of your personal portfolio. 

I'm using the awesome stock data supplied by (Alpha vantage)["https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#"] in order to get minute by minute updates. JSON format.

TODO's:
  - Allow user input to add the portfolio themselves (small). 
  - Build some graphs from the data (large).
  - Allow multiple searches for different forms of stocks (small).
  - Implement a save and load system to tell you how well your current tracked stock since you last launched the app (large).
