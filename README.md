# StockIntake
A console app that analyzes stocks from a live API and applies basic stock taking algorithms to the data.

I'm using the awesome stock data supplied by [Alpha vantage]("https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#") in order to get minute by minute updates. JSON format.

TODO's:
  - Build some graphs from the data
  - Allow multiple searches for different forms of stocks
  - Implement a save and load system to tell you how well your current tracked stock is doing
